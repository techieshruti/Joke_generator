- **Async JavaScript**: using `fetch()`, `.then()`, and how APIs work
- **Error handling** with `.catch()` for graceful fallback
- **DOM manipulation** with `innerHTML`, event listeners
- **How to work with audio in JS**
- **CSS styling** for animation, transitions, spotlight effect
- **Working in GitHub Codespaces** and hosting assets (like `laugh.mp3`)
